## Project Ideas
### Visualize Plant Data (Electrical Current..) and train a model on the visualized images, in order to give some feedback
### The next Step in Gardening
Withing this project we want to add human attributes to a confined plant. This shall be the next step in the plant evolution. It struck us, how people care about their houseplant.   The detail of these interaction are sometimes very complex. With our project we want to give feedback from the plant. This feedback might range from a plant moving where the environment suits best, the plant reacting to peoples emotions or even the plant communicatin in text.
### How do you like plants
A series of different plant in confined environments, ranging from beautiful to ugly. People shall display their connection to these plants in emotions. Based on a map of happy - grim the terrariums will either try to destroy or keep the plants alive.
Have a setup of where to put faces ("RÃ¶ntgenraum Zahnarzt") scane emotions, display live data of terrarium.
