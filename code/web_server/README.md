# Web Server

## About
This webserver uses flask and simple html to display all images in the _images folder

## Usage
Run the file app.py with python. There will then be an exposed url at port 5000 which we can access to view all the images inside the _images folder. This may be beneficial when analysing OpenCV Results ..
